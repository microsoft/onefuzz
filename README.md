# OneFuzz

## A self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform

Project OneFuzz enables continuous developer-driven fuzzing to proactively
harden software prior to release.  With a [single 
command](docs/getting-started.md#launching-a-job), which can be [baked into
CICD](contrib/onefuzz-job-github-actions/README.md), developers can launch
fuzz jobs from a few virtual machines to thousands of cores.

## Build Status

![Build Onefuzz](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Features

* **Composable fuzzing workflows**: Open source allows users to onboard their own 
   fuzzers, [swap instrumentation](docs/custom-analysis.md), and manage seed inputs.
* **Built-in ensemble fuzzing**: By default, fuzzers work as a team to share strengths, 
   swapping inputs of interest between fuzzing technologies.
* **Programmatic triage and result de-duplication**: It provides unique flaw cases that 
   always reproduce.
* **On-demand live-debugging of found crashes**: It lets you summon a live debugging
   session on-demand or from your build system.
* **Observable and Debug-able**: Transparent design allows introspection into every 
   stage.
* **Fuzz on Windows and Linux**: Multi-platform by design. Fuzz using your own [OS 
   build](docs/custom-images.md), kernel, or nested hypervisor.
* **Crash reporting notification callbacks**: Including [Azure DevOps Work
   Items](docs/notifications/ado.md) and [Microsoft Teams
   messages](docs/notifications/teams.md)
