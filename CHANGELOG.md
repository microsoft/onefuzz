## 7.0.0

## BREAKING CHANGES

* This release has fully deprecated `jinja` templates and will only accept `scriban` templates.
* The `onefuzz config` command has removed the `--authority` and `--tenant_domain` parameters. The only _required_ parameter for interactive use is the `--endpoint` parameters. The other values needed for authentication are now retrieved dynamically.
* The recording components used in the `coverage` task have been rewritten for improved source-level reporting. The task-level API has one breaking change: the `coverage_filter` field has been removed and replaced by the `module_allowlist` and `source_allowlist` fields. See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/blob/5bfcc4e242aa041d8c067471ee2e81904589a79e/src/agent/coverage/README.md#allowlists) for documentation of the new format.
* The old `dotnet` template has been removed and `dotnet_dll` is now `dotnet`.

## 6.0.0

## BREAKING CHANGES

### Manual Deployment Step

When upgrading from version 5.20 a manual step is required. Before deploying 6.0 delete both Azure App Functions and the Azure App Service plan before upgrading. This is required because we have migrated the service from `python` to `C#`.

After deployment, there will be two App Functions deployed, one with the name of the deployment and a second one with the same name and a `-net` suffix. This is a temporary situation and the `-net` app function will be removed in a following release.

If you have not used the deployment parameters to deploy C# functions in 5.20, you can manually delete the `-net` app function immediately. Deploying the C# functions was not a default action in 5.20, for most deployments deleting the `-net` app function immediately is ok.

### Deprecation of jinja templates

With this release we are moving from jinja templates to [scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban) templates. See the documentation for [scriban here](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc).

Version 6.0 will convert jinja templates on-the-fly for a short period of time. We do **_not_** guarantee that this will be successful for all jinja template options. These on-the-fly conversions are not persisted in the notifications table in this release. They will be in a following release. This will allow time for conversions of templates that are not handled by the current automatic conversion process.

### CLI

The default value for the `--container_type` parameter to the `container` command has been removed. The `container_type` parameter is still required for the command. This change removes the ambiguity of the container information being returned.

### Added

* Agent: Added `machine_id` a parameter of the agent config. [#2649](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2649)
* Agent: Pass the `machine_id` from the Agent to the Task. [#2662](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2662)

### Changed

* Service: Deployment enables refactored C# App Function. [#2650](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2650)

If you have set a client secret in your configuration file in a public client, we recommending removing and revoking it. CI scripts that currently set the client secret in the config must instead pass it via the `ONEFUZZ_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable or on each CLI invocation via the `--client_secret` argument.
