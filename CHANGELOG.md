### Changed
* Agent/Service: Refactored state management for on-vm supervisors [#96](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/96)
* Agent: Added 'done' semaphore to the agent to prevent agent from fetching additional work once the node should be reset.  [#86](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/86)
* Agent: Nodes now sleep longer between checking for new work.  [#78](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/78)

* Agent: Instance specific tools now download and run on windows nodes as expected [#81](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/81)
* CLI: Using `--wait_for_running` in `onefuzz template` jobs now properly waits for tasks to launch before exiting [#84](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/84)
* Service: Handled more Azure Devops notification errors [#80](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/80)
