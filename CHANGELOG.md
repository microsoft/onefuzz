## 1.3.1
### Added
* Testing: Added rust based libfuzzer in the end-to-end integration tests [#132](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/132)

### Fixed
* Agent: Always parse STDERR when generating crash reports for LibFuzzer instead of using `ASAN_OPTIONS=log_path`, which fixes crash reports from non-sanitizer based crashes. [#131](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/131)
* Deployment: Added data-migration script to fix notifications for pre-release installs [#135](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/135)

## 1.3.0
### Added
* Agent: Crash reports for LibFuzzer now attempts to parse STDERR in addition to `ASAN_OPTIONS=log_path`.  This enables crash reporting of go-fuzz based binaries.  [#127](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/127)
* Deployment: During deployment, App Insights logs can be configured to automatically export logs to the `app-insights` container in instance specific `func` storage account.  [#102](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/102)

### Changed
* Agent: Reduced logs sent from the agent [#125](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/125)
* Service: Scalesets now use [multiple placement groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-placement-groups#placement-groups), allowing a scaleset to grow to 1000 nodes (or 600 if using a custom image).  [#121](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/121)

### Fixed
* Deployment: Support deploying additional platforms (such as OSX).  [#126](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/126)
* Service: Fixed typing error in sorting TaskEvent.  [#129](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/129)

## 1.2.0
### Added
* CLI/Service: Added creating and updating [Github Issues](docs/notifications/github.md) based on crash reports.  [#110](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/110)

### Changed
* Agent: Libfuzzer fuzzing that exits with a non-zero exit code without a resulting crashing input now mark the task as failed.  [#108](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/108)
* Service: The automatic variable `repro_cmd` used in [crash report notifications](docs/notifications.md) now includes '--endpoint URL' to reduce friction for users with multiple OneFuzz instances.  [#113](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/113)

* CLI: Added documentation of CLI sub-command arguments (used to describe `afl_container` in AFL templates [#10](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/10)
* Agent: Added `ONEFUZZ_TARGET_SETUP_PATH` environment variable that indicates the path to the task specific setup container on the fuzzing nodes [#15](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/15)
* CICD: Use [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) to speed up build times [#47](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/47)

### Changed
* Agent/Service: Refactored state management for on-vm supervisors [#96](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/96)
* Agent: Added 'done' semaphore to the agent to prevent agent from fetching additional work once the node should be reset.  [#86](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/86)
